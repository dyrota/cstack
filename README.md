# cstack

A skill pack that turns GitHub Copilot into a virtual engineering team. Opinionated slash commands for every phase of a sprint — plan, review, test, debug, and ship — built on VS Code's [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) open standard.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repo anywhere
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/dyrota/cstack.git
cd cstack

# Personal install (works across all projects)
./setup
# Skills → ~/.vscode/agents/skills/
# Agents → ~/.github/agents/

# OR: Project install (from within your project)
./setup --local
# Skills → <project-root>/.agents/skills/
# Agents → <project-root>/.github/agents/
```

## Skills

| Command | Role | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `/plan` | Engineering Manager | Interactive implementation plan with diagrams |
| `/review` | Staff Engineer | Find production bugs before they ship |
| `/test` | Tester | Run tests, find gaps, write missing coverage |
| `/ship` | Release Engineer | Sync, test, commit, open PR |
| `/debug` | Debugger | Systematic root-cause debugging |
| `/checkpoint` | Staff Engineer | Save and resume working context across sessions |
| `/retro` | Engineering Manager | Weekly retrospective from git history |
| `/document` | Documenter | Sync docs after shipping |

## Workflow

```
/plan → [implement] → /review → /test → /ship
                                          ↑
                               /debug anytime
                        /checkpoint to save/resume
                         /retro for weekly review
                     /document to sync docs after ship
```

Use `/skill` to run a phase. Use `@agent` to work with a persona.

## Agents

| Agent | Role | Model |
|---|---|---|
| `@planner` | Read-only planning | claude-opus-4.6 → claude-sonnet-4.6 |
| `@reviewer` | Code review (reports only) | claude-opus-4.6 → claude-sonnet-4.6 |
| `@implementer` | Full-edit implementation | claude-opus-4.6 → claude-sonnet-4.6 |
| `@tester` | Test coverage and verification | claude-opus-4.6 → claude-sonnet-4.6 |

> `@chronicler` is used internally by `/checkpoint` and does not appear in the agents dropdown.

## Post-MVP Skills

These are **designed but not yet implemented** — invoking them will not work. They are included here as a roadmap:

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/think` | Reframe the problem before writing code (forcing questions, 3 approaches) |
| `/audit` | Security review: OWASP Top 10 + STRIDE threat model |

## Why

Copilot is powerful. cstack makes it structured. Each skill knows its role, its tools, and when to hand off to the next step.

See [SPEC.md](./SPEC.md) for the full design.
